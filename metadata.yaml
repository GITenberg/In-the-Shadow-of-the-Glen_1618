description: 'Dan Burke, it seems, is dead, his body lying on his bed beneath a sheet.
  His young wife Nora has taken a tramp into the house, a man seeking refuge from
  the cruel weather of the valley in which she lives. They pass pleasantries until
  Nora''s intended arrives, a neighbouring shepherd named Michael Dara, with whom
  Nora schemes a fresh union even while her husband''s body is not yet cold. The comic
  surprise that follows is a magnificent ''coup de theâtre'': that it is followed
  by a dénouement as unexpected as any the Irish theatre had seen speaks volumes to
  Synge''s sophistication as a playwright and master of his craft. The play was first
  performed in Dublin in 1903.'
